# Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App

## Overview
Welcome to the "Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App" repository! This project is designed to provide a user-friendly web application for predicting multiple diseases based on various input features. The application leverages machine learning models trained on specific datasets to make predictions about potential health conditions.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders and files:

- **`Multiple disease Prediction System.py`**: The main Streamlit application file. This script contains the code to launch the web app and handle user inputs to predict diseases.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python libraries required to run the Streamlit app. Install these dependencies before running the app.
- **`/sav_files`**: Contains the saved model files used for predictions.
- **`/data_models`**: This folder contains the datasets used for training the models. 
- **`/background_pic`**: Contains background images used in the Streamlit interface.
